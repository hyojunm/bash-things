# bash-things :computer:

A collection of fun and useful bash scripts!

## Build instructions

First, navigate to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Then, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyojunm/bash-things.git
```

To run the scripts, open your `.bashrc` file inside the home directory and add this line at the end:

```bash
source ~/bash-things/load_settings.sh
```

If you did not clone the repository in your home directory, replace `~/bash-things/load_settings.sh` accordingly. You will also need to edit the `load_settings.sh` file with the correct paths.
